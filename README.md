Some interactive p5 math animations

All files are sketch.js files to be toyed with in the p5js web editor. 
To dsplay them locally on a web browser, use the tiny html and css files provided (copied from the p5 web editor).

The AngleOfParallism and HyperbolicBilliards files include several functions that can be used more generally to construct an interactive model of the Poincar√© Disk.
